# ⚠️ Project Archived — Moved to **tfren**

> **Terraform Split (tfsplit)** has been officially **archived** and replaced by its successor:
> 👉 **[https://github.com/obay/tfren](https://github.com/obay/tfren)**

**tfren** is the next evolution of this idea — more capable, more flexible, and actively maintained.
If you’re using `tfsplit`, this is your sign to upgrade.

---

## Why this repository exists

`tfsplit` was created to solve a simple but common Terraform problem:

> “I have one giant `main.tf`. I want clean, readable, logically split files.”

It did that job well.
Then the problem grew.

As workflows became more complex, it became clear that **splitting files is only one part of a larger refactoring story**. Rather than bolting features onto `tfsplit`, the tool was reborn properly as **tfren**.

## 🚀 The Future: **tfren**

**tfren** is the actively maintained replacement and should be used for all new work.

* Designed for modern Terraform refactoring workflows
* Cleaner architecture
* More powerful transformations
* Ongoing development and improvements

👉 **Migrate now:** [https://github.com/obay/tfren](https://github.com/obay/tfren)
